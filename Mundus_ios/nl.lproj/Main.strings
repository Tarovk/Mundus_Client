Suddenly, a bell starts to ring in the control room. A text appears on one of the computer screens: ‘planet_in_sight’.\n\nSara sits straight up in bed. \n\n‘Huh? What was that?’ She looks through the port- hole and sees that they are slowly but surely drawing near an unknown planet.\n\n‘Wow. I would like to take a look around there!’ Sara cries. She wakes up the other two passengers.\n\n‘It’s only 14 minutes past  ve!’ Sophie grumbles.\n\n‘I am entitled to another 76 mi- nutes of sleep.’\n\nBut then she sees Sara standing at the porthole.\n\n‘Come look, it’s beautiful!’ says Sara.\n\n‘I see an ocean.\n\nAnd hills and a river. And all that green stu  – can those be plants?’\n\nSophie’s eyes begin to shine. ‘It is lovely, isn’t it.’\n\nFinally, even Milan wakes up. \n\nWhen he looks through the porthole and sees the strange planet, his mouth falls open in amazement.\n\n‘It looks like there is life on that planet.

And look, I see animals too.\n\nWe have dis- covered alien life!’ Milan says.\n\nSara grins at him. \n\n‘Hey, I see animals with a sort of shell. \n\nI’ll call them shell- beasts for now. \n\nHave you two noticed those creatures there? \n\nDo you think they built all those houses?’\n\n‘Wait a minute,’ Milan replies. \n\n‘What makes you so sure that they are houses?\n\nThey could be very unusual trees. \n\nWe need more information before we can say for sure, don’t you think, Sophie?’\n\n‘You are right,’ says Sophie. \n\n‘The Mayas in South America had all sorts of buil- dings that turned out to be temples, not houses. \n\nLet’s take some notes so that we don’t forget everything later on.’\n\nSophie takes her laptop and starts typing. \n\n‘There seem to be di erent species of animals here, and di erent varieties of plants.’\n\n‘They have paint too – have you noticed?’ \n\nMilan points to one of the creatures, who is painting yellow shapes.\n\n‘Maybe there is iron in the soil,’ says Sophie. \n\n‘We use that on Earth to make yel- low paint.’\n\n‘OK, we are about to land!’ says Sara, and grasps the spaceship’s steering wheel.\n\nThey land the Explora carefully in an open area. \n\nThey have arrived.\n\nSophie takes her laptop, a thermometer and a few\nother items and they go outside. \n\nNow that the engines have been switched o , it is suddenly eerily quiet.\n\nBut then they hear a chorus of voices crying ‘Pi!
